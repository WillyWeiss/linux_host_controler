# Linux Host Controler
## What it dose?
You can use this script as an adblocker but also as an parental/access control preventig users behind the machine to access certain domain/websites

## How is working?
This script is a simple wrapper around downloading, compile and installing multiple hosts file in order to prevent adds but also provieds a menu driven control over the entire hosts file. 
Using such a hosts file ensures adblocking, and a good level of privacy from tracker networks. However, I recommend to complement it with a browser plugin that can block trackers on a site-by-site basis

## Install and Use

```sh
git clone https://github.com/WillyWeiss/linux_host_controler.git
cd linux_host_controler
sudo chmo +x linux_host_controler.sh
./linux_host_controler.sh
